Cyclus Installation Guide
#########################

Cyclus uses the ``CMake`` cross-platform build-generator. To
simplify the usage of cmake to build Cyclus from source, a python script is
provided with the source.

.. website_include_start

Before going further with the installation procedure be sure you have installed
all the required dependencies. We have provided detailed
instructions `for installing those dependencies for the major supported systems`_.


Default Installation
--------------------

Run the install script:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  python3 install.py

If you successfully followed the instruction above, the cyclus binary has been
generated and placed in the  ``~/.local/`` in your home directory. 
You need to add ``~/.local/bin`` to the front of your ``$PATH``:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc

On MacOSX you also need to add ~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages to your
``$PYTHONPATH``:

.. code-block:: bash

  echo "export PYTHONPATH=\"\$HOME/.local/lib/python`python3 -c 'import sys; \
  print(".".join(map(str, sys.version_info[:2])))'`/site-packages:\$PYTHONPATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc

Custom Cyclus Installation
--------------------------

The installation using the install script can be customized using the following
flags:

.. list-table::

  * - ``-h, --help``                              
    - show the help message and exit                                                                   

  * - ``--build-dir BUILD_DIR``

  * - ``--clean-build``

    - THREADS the number of threads to use in the make step                                            

  * - ``--prefix PREFIX``                         
    - the relative path to the installation directory                                                  

  * - ``--config-only``                           
    - only configure the package, do not build or install                                              

  * - ``--build-only``                            
    - only build the package, do not install                                                           

  * - ``--test``                                  
    - run tests after  building                                                                        

  * - ``--coin-root COIN_ROOT``                   
    - the relative path to the Coin-OR libraries directory                                             

  * - ``--boost-root BOOST_ROOT``                 
    - the relative path to the Boost libraries directory                                               

  * - ``--hdf5-root HDF5_ROOT``                   
    - the path to the HDF5 libraries directory                                                         

  * - ``--cmake-prefix-path CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``

For example, if you have installed coin-Cbc from source or otherwise have it
installed in a non-standard location, you should make use of the ``coin_root``
installation flag. The otherwise identical process would look like:

.. code-block:: bash

    .../cyclus$  python3 install.py --coin-root=path/to/coin


CMake Cyclus Installation
-------------------------

If you are ``CMake`` aficionado you can also install Cyclus without using the
``install.py`` python script and use ``cmake`` directly, which should look like:


.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local/
  make
  make install

As usual you can customize your cmake installation using the proper cmake flag.
All cmake variables can be listed using: ``cmake -LAH``.
The main variables used are:

.. list-table::

  * - ``COIN_ROOT_DIR`` 
    - set Coin-OT library directory 

  * - ``BOOST_ROOT``    
    - set Boost libraries directory

  * - ``HDF5_ROOT``     
    - set HDF5 root directory

  * - ``HDF5_LIBRARIES`` 
    - set HDF5 libraries path

  * - ``HDF5_LIBRARY_DIRS`` 
    - set HDF5 library directory

  * - ``HDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS`` 
    - set HDF5 include directory

All variables can be set using ``-DMY_VARIABLE=MY_VARIABLES_VALUE``.

Note on Building Cyclus with Conda
----------------------------------

If your python libraries are installed using Conda, install cyclus
dependencies through conda-forge.

.. code-block:: bash

  conda config --add channels conda-forge
  conda install cyclus --only-deps


*************
Running Tests
*************

Installing Cyclus will also install a test driver (i.e., an executable of all of
our tests). We strongly recommend after a fresh install of Cyclus, or after
any modification on the source code, to rerun those tests in order to insure the
proper functioning of Cyclus. You can run the tests yourself via:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cyclus_unit_tests
